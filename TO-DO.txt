Goal: An interpreter for Brainfuck, capable of reading from a file or taking input from the user (scary!)

Program Outline:

1.) Accept flags from the command line to indicate whether a file is being used or if the user is inputting Brainfuck code
	// "-file" could indicate the file to be used
	// According to K&R, the args should be accepted in any order
	// Thus, a loop through all *argv is necessary

2.)
